## Introduction
Welcome to my PyTorch learning repository! Actually, i already use PyTorch for 2 year in some project. But sometimes, i feel like forget about how it's work. So now, i decided to review again and try to learn back to basic for strong foundational. I am using the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens and Luca Antiga as my primary resource to guide my learning journey with this powerful deep learning framework. My goal is to gain a strong foundation in PyTorch and be able to use it to develop and train neural networks for a variety of tasks.

## Resources
To guide my learning, I am using the following resources:

* The book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" by Eli Stevens, Luca Antiga, and Thomas Viehmann
* The official PyTorch tutorial: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/

## Progress
* Read chapters 1-4 of the book
* Completed exercises on introduction, pretrained networks, tensors, and tensor representation for real world data

## Future goals
* Finish reading the book and complete all exercises
* Work on a real-world project using PyTorch, such as training a model for image data and text data (image recognition, object detection, image segmentation, etc)
* Explore more advanced topics in PyTorch, such as GAN, style transfer and reinforcement learning

## Conclusion
Overall, I have found the book "Deep Learning with PyTorch" to be a valuable resource for learning PyTorch. The authors do a great job of explaining complex concepts in an accessible way, and the exercises have helped me solidify my understanding of the material. I am excited to continue my learning journey with PyTorch and see where it takes me.
